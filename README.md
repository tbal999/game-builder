# game-builder
a simple command line for building dungeon crawler games (under construction)

Commands:
buildobject: create an object.
allobject: view all objects by name and index
viewobject: allows you to view object (type in name)
placeobject: place object on the map (type in co-ordinates)
buildmap: allows you to create an X by X map by an index
viewworld: prints out all maps by index.
viewmap: prints out map by index. First map would be 0, second 1 etc.
play: initiates the game
q: exit the game

Objects:
ID - generated automatically
name - string
description - string
health - integer
attack - integer

Maps are a 3D slice generated by x, y width/length:
i.e a 3,3 map will be:
000
000
000

Placing objects on the map:
First you type in name of object you wish to place.
then the map index i.e first map is 0, second map will be 1 and so on.
Then you choose the x,y coordinates to place the object.
The first object you generate will be indexed at 0 and will present itself as "1" on the map. This object will be the hero character.
If objects have attack, then they can be fought against.
If objects have 0 attack, then no combat will be initiated and you can do other things like provide descriptive text.

Play:
When you press play, you will be able to control the hero character and navigate the world.

TODO:
Implement save functionality.
implement load functionality.

Long-term todo:
Create a GUI on top of this interface, maybe a web app, so that it can be used to create dnd-lite scenarios.
